The issue stems from an inconsistent handling of asynchronous operations within Firebase's real-time database interaction.  Specifically, the `onValue` listener might be triggered multiple times unexpectedly, leading to duplicated data or overwritten values. This is exacerbated when dealing with concurrent updates or network latency. The problem is difficult to pinpoint because the behavior is non-deterministic and depends on the timing of asynchronous callbacks and the network conditions.
